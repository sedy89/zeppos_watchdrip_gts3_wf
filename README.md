Info: *The Watchface is changing the inner circle color based on the BG status. Low -> red, In Range -> green, high -> yellow/orange.*
*If the WF detects an IOB value provided by the insulin pump, it'll show this value instead of the estimated IOB value from Xdrip.*

This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_app">Companion APP</a>  and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband">Patreon page</a>). The base of this watchface can be found here [https://amazfitwatchfaces.com/gts/view/9844](https://amazfitwatchfaces.com/gts/view/9648) and was created by don1yoor.
The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by usin ZEPP OS fetch API.

Compile the watchface yourself and change those parameters if required (watchface/gts3/styles.js)
